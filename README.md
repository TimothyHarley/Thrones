# Thrones

### About This App
The Game of Thrones app was an in-class project.  Our instructor walked us through creating this app step-by-step starting at the planning stages.  We learned about using more complicated file structure and breaking up javascript into smaller, more manageable chunks using modules to export 
and import blocks of code.  We also learned how to JavaScript Object Notation (Json) and XML Http Requests (XHR).
